# ScorchedUnity2D
my own re-interpretation of the mother of all games

## Current status

* [x] naive, big blocks of destructible terrain
* [x] wind
* [x] user controls tank
* [x] first attempt at todo-stack (so not all tanks can shoot at the same time)
* [x] baby missile
* [x] explosion destroys terrain
* [ ] GUI reflects current tank's status
* [ ] Computer controlled tanks
* [ ] screen borders
* [ ] use destructible terrain from <https://github.com/Ideefixze/DTerrain>
* [ ] Unsupported terrain should/might drop
* [ ] More weapons!   *More!*   ***MORE!***
